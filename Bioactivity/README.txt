To run Using_ML_to_predict_bioActivity_of_covid_drugs.ipynb file in local system or google colab.

Local System:
-One must have anaconda installed to run.
-Descriptor csv is also included in this zip, so if the descritor creation won't run locally just ignore that part and use already provided csv.
-That is it.
-There might occur some problem as i haven't ran it locally. But this should supposedly run smoothly.

Google Collab
-Uncomment certain code parts(A comment is written whether it is needed or not in colab).
-Rest of it will run smoothly.

descriptors_output.csv file is generated in code and will be used to train our model.
data_final.csv file is preprocessed and cleaned dataset of downloaded data from ChEMBL. Which furthur used to create descriptors.
